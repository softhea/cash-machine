## Assumptions

### All amounts were considered integers.
### The 20000 and 10000 limits were considered for the lifetime of the system.
### Authentication, Authorization and anything User related were not considered.
### The tests were written only with happy flows to help me test my changes.
### "On form submit the transactions must be stored in Database (total amount and inputs as JSON)" - I only stored the data on successful submition.
### The FrontEnd is basic, just to showcase the BackEnd.
